### Summary
A game that allows to players to play checkers against an AI or another user local.

### MVP
The behavior of the Minimal Viable Product for a checkers program would be to enable two players to play a standard game of checkers with all the basic rules enforced, including moves, jumps, and kinging, on a digital board.

### Technologies
We will be using Java for all the main coding stuff. I'm also gonna use React to make the website part look good and work well. Plus, We will use JSON for sending data back and forth between the website and the game.

### additional behavior 
we'll enhance the single-player mode by introducing a smarter AI opponent with various difficulty levels. We'll also add functionality to save and replay games, which will enhance the user experience without the complexity of online multiplayer features.

### additional technologies
You know how projects are. We just start thinking more thing to add mid project if not following a read me instructions.

### additional behavior
I'll try to add multiplayer if time allows, but I know it will be challenging.
